                    <p>In light of the Presidential AI Challenge, the CESASC AI Challenge serves as a regional initiative that brings together K–12 students, educators, mentors, and community teams to address real-world problems in their communities using AI-powered solutions. Participants have the opportunity to showcase their work across Southern California. Students of all backgrounds and experience levels are encouraged to participate.</p>
                    
                    <p>The CESASC AI Challenge adopts essentially the same evaluation criteria as the Presidential AI Challenge. Its goal is to serve as a stepping stone to the Presidential AI Challenge, while also providing an additional opportunity for students to connect, collaborate, and learn from one another at the local level.</p>
